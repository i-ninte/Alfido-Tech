Uber is a multinational transportation network company that operates a platform connecting riders with drivers through a mobile app. It was founded in 2009 and has become one of the most well-known examples of a ride-hailing service. Uber allows users to request a ride from their current location to a desired destination using their smartphone. The app matches the user with an available driver in the area, who arrives to pick up the passenger.

Uber offers various types of services, including UberX (standard car), UberXL (larger vehicles), UberBlack (luxury vehicles), and UberPOOL (shared rides with other passengers traveling in the same direction). The fares for rides are calculated based on factors such as distance traveled, time spent on the trip, and demand at the time of the request.

Uber has gained popularity for its convenience, ease of use, and competitive pricing compared to traditional taxi services. It has expanded its operations to numerous cities around the world and has also introduced other services like food delivery (Uber Eats) and package delivery (Uber Connect).

## ABOUT DATASET

1. **START_DATE**: This column contains the date and time when a ride started. It is crucial for analyzing patterns related to the time of day, day of the week, and month.

2. **END_DATE**: Similar to the START_DATE, this column provides the date and time when a ride ended. It is essential for calculating the duration of rides and understanding when rides are more frequent.

3. **CATEGORY**: The CATEGORY column likely categorizes the type of ride, providing insights into the nature of the trips (e.g., business, personal). This can be useful for segmenting and analyzing the data based on ride categories.

4. **START**: The START column specifies a ride's starting point or location. It helps in analyzing popular pick-up locations, identifying common routes, and understanding geographical patterns.

5. **STOP**: This column indicates the stopping point or destination of a ride. Similar to the START column, it contributes to the analysis of popular drop-off locations and overall travel patterns.

6. **MILES**: The MILES column represents the distance traveled during each ride in miles. It is essential for understanding the length of rides and can be used to analyze trends related to trip distance.

7. **PURPOSE**: The PURPOSE column contains information about the purpose of the ride (e.g., business meetings, personal errands). Analyzing this column can provide insights into the primary reasons for rides and may help identify patterns related to specific purposes.


## PROJECT SUMMARY
**1. Data Cleaning:**
   - **Missing Values:** Handled missing values in the dataset, ensuring that essential columns like START_DATE, END_DATE, CATEGORY, START, STOP, and MILES have complete data.
   - **Data Types:** Ensured appropriate data types for columns, converting START_DATE and END_DATE to datetime format.
   - **Duplicates:** Checked and addressed any duplicate entries in the dataset.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - **Time Analysis:**
      - Extracted hour and day information from START_DATE for time-based analysis.
      - Investigated the distribution of rides over different times of the day.
      - Explored the variation in the number of rides on weekdays vs. weekends.

   - **Geographical Analysis:**
      - Analyzed popular start and stop locations to identify common routes.
   
   - **Purpose Analysis:**
      - Explored if certain purposes are more common during specific times or days.
      - Analyzed the average distance traveled for different purposes.

   - **Statistical Analysis:**
      - Investigated income patterns over time using the START_DATE column.

**3. Visualization:**
   - Created various visualizations, including line plots and count plots, to represent the distribution of rides, income analysis, and purpose-specific analysis.

**4. Challenges and Further Steps:**
   - Addressed challenges in the data, such as missing values in the PURPOSE column.
   - Suggested further steps for analysis, such as identifying times of price fluctuations (if price data were available) and exploring patterns related to the day of the week and time of the day.

**5. Summary:**
   - The analysis provided insights into the temporal, geographical, and purpose-related patterns of the rides.
   - Visualizations enhanced the understanding of ride distribution, income patterns, and the relationship between time and purposes.

**6. Recommendations:**
   - Based on the analysis, recommendations could be made for optimizing ride services during peak times, improving route efficiency, and tailoring services based on popular purposes.
